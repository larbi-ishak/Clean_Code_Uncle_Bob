// Functions should implement single responsibility principle
// just do one thing

// when using variables in functions
// define them as near as you use them  (just in time)
// not in the first of the function beginning


// More than 3 parameters combine them in one object

// dirty
// function(name, ige, state, age, nationality){

// clean
// you can also destruct it
function(info){
