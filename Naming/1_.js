/**
 * Naming matters
 * avoid names in one letter like , p , s, t ...
 * Classes should be names not verbs
 * keep name precise and specific, but not large
 * avoid unnecessary suffixes
 */

/**
 * Methods in classes should not be just verbs
 * like: get , process, set
 * add suffix to verbs in methods naming
 */

/**
 * Avoid side effects in methods and functions
 *
 * validate_user() should validate user not validate and login user and get user info
 */

/**
 * Abbreviation: don't do it plz,
 * it's not the 80's storage now is available and cheap
 * and he problem is there is no rule,standard for abbreviation
 * even more , now days , there is autocompletion in your IDE
 * RegUsr() is best or RegisterUser()
 */

/**
 * Boolean naming: boolean values should look like true/false
 *
 * these are dirty
 * status, login_stat, age_condition
 *
 * clean:
 * is_valid, is_logged, is_age_checked, done, loggedIn, is_active
 */

/**
 * Pairs naming:
 * when you have contrast pairs, choose the right contrast
 *
 * dirty:
 * min/high  loose/victory  lock/open
 *
 * clean:
 * min/max loose/win lock/unlock enable/disable
 *
